Heap data stucture :

Heap Sort :

pid : process ID, this was used for a kernel so it can be replaced from pid to whatever value you want


you can change the values in the structure to what suits you

1) the priority is what the heapify uses as comparisons
2) pid is the related unique value for each heap node.
3) priorityDef (priorDef) is similar to the priority value.
